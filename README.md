Instructions
Overview
For your Capstone Project, youâ€™ll build a complex database-driven Website using React, Node,
Express and MongoDB. This website will be powered either off of an external API or an API that
you build yourself. We encourage you to create your own API if you cannot find one with the
data you are looking for. You can do this through web scraping, importing a CSV, or loading
your own data into the API.
